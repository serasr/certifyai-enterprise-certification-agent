By default, agents use OpenAI's file search capability with the documents in the `src/files` folder. To enable Azure AI Search instead, set the environment variable before the first time of provision and deployment:

```shell
azd env set USE_AZURE_AI_SEARCH_SERVICE true
```

When Azure AI Search is enabled, the same files in `src/files` are uploaded to your Storage Account blob container and indexed by Azure AI Search.
